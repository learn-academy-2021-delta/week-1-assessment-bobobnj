# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a digital tracking device for changes in digital works. How Github is different from git is how coffee is different from Starbucks. Git is the coffee and Github being the Starbucks.

  Researched answer: Git is a command-line tool installed locally on terminal and uses a Linux based command where-as Github is a cloudspace maintained by Microsoft and focuses on centralized source code hosting.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Things that are true or false

  Researched answer: Boolean values use two types of equality operators (strict and loose) in order to provide a true or false outcome. This easily allows the coder to evaluate data when comparing values.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Indexes are place holders while values are the leverage that index carries.

  Researched answer: Indexes are the length property of a string and the first place starts with 0

4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are code within a code.

  Researched answer:  Built-in methods are pre-made functionalities created in to Javascript to prevent the user from reinventing the wheel. THey are practically designed for string datatypes and use additional information called arguments in order to execute the functions.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There are drivers and navigators. The driver does all of the typing while the navigator navigates through the code directions. Each party should check the driver for errors and contribute to the creativity of the project. The roles should switch periodically.

  Researched answer: The Driver is hands on and keyboard sitting while following the instructions of the driver. The navigator gives the instructions to the driver.


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Git status and the emphasis on it's importance became an integral tool for whatever progress I made navigating in terminal with Github.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: executes block-code relelentlessly until a condition is met. Works especially efficient with string and array data-types.

2. Higher Order Functions: Are assigned to variables like arrays and strings. They are used to set parameters for functions.

3. Jest: A javascript programmed designed to ensure correctness of coding.

4. Objects: Cars, planes, books, and buildings. Javascript uses Objects.

5. Classes: Functions that contain data and behavior which are considered blueprints for objects in Javascript.

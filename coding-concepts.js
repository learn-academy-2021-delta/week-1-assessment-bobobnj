// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

<<<<<<< HEAD
                var cohort = "Delta 2021"
                // console.log(cohort.length)
                //// Answer = (10) because the request id for the length of the datatype. 

                //// Strings have a length property held in place by an index. There are 10 spaces, or indexes,
                //// therefore, when you run cohort.length you recieve a length of 10.

var cohort = "Delta 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

<<<<<<< HEAD
// a) Your answer: This will either produce "l" for "Hell" because of the direction given by the [3].


// b) Verify and explain: The answer is "l". You can reference a single character by isolating the index using
// brackets[]. Since the first insdex is representd by 0, the 3 position would be the 2nd "l" in hello.

// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

<<<<<<< HEAD
// a) Your answer: The variable index was assigned a value of 1 so it should index to the 1 position and "Ruby"
// is the expected result.

// b) Verify and explain: Ruby is the correct result and as explain above, because the var index was assigned a value,
// it takes the place of numerical one and therefore indexes to the 2nd string position.

// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

<<<<<<< HEAD
// a) Your answer: This should uppercase all the letters in saturday and sunday toUpperCase is a built
// in function that capitalizes all characters within the variable it's assigned to.

// b) Verify and explain: An error was returned. It appears the brackets around the contents of the variable
// ( ["saturday", "sunday"] ), and the seperate quotation marks prevent the code from running correctly.

        //Correct code:
        var weekendDays = "saturday, sunday"
        console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase());

// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

<<<<<<< HEAD
// a) Your answer: I remember reading about the typeof logging datatypes as variables. It was referenced in a
// challenge as well but that is about all I remember.

// b) Verify and explain: The code logged length. According to the Javascript typeof operators page, this will
// identify the datatype in the variable and in this case the dataype was a number type.
